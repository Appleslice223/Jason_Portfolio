# How you doin
The reason I got into **Graphic Design**  was because of video games mostly because video games had *HUGE* effect on my life ever since age ~8. Ever since then i've wanted to design and create stuff that other can see and judge, so that they can give feedback on ways that I can improve on where the flaws show up
